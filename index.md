## About Me

I am a second-year ScM Biostatistics student at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/), where I am fortunate to work under the guidance of [Dr. Chen Hu](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/chen-hu/2777794) and [Dr. Yiqun T. Chen](https://yiqunchen.github.io/).

I’m interested in developing, evaluating, and applying statistical methods that use data from (1) multiple endpoints, (2) cross-study/cross-source settings, and (3) diverse formats (e.g., text) to improve population health and well-being.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) with a double major in Public Health and Environmental Science, and a minor in Applied Math and Statistics (May 2024).

I’m always happy to collaborate! If you’re interested in working together, feel free to reach out to me at wzhan115[at]jhu.edu.
