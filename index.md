## About Me

I am a second-year ScM Biostatistics student at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/), where I am fortunate to work under the guidance of [Dr. Chen Hu](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/chen-hu/2777794) and [Dr. Yiqun T. Chen](https://yiqunchen.github.io/).

My current research focuses on developing, benchmarking, and evaluating statistical methods that leverage modern machine-learning techniques to improve evidence synthesis and risk prediction in clinical and observational studies.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at the [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) with a double major in Public Health and Environmental Science, and a minor in Applied Math and Statistics (May 2024).

I’m always happy to collaborate! If you’re interested in working together, feel free to reach out to me at wzhan115[at]jhu.edu.
