## About Me

I am a second-year ScM student in Biostatistics at the [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Chen Hu](https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/chen-hu/2777794).

My current research focus on developing, benchmarking, and evaluating statistical methods that leverage modern machine-learning techniques to improve evidence synthesis and risk prediction in clinical and observational studies.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University with a double major in Public Health and Environmental Science, and a minor in Applied Math and Statistics (May 2024).

I’m always happy to collaborate! If you’re interested in working together, feel free to reach out to me at wzhan115[at]jhu.edu.
